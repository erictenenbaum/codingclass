Into to Firebase:

.ref() gives you the ability to add directories or reference directories in your database
Create
Read
Update
Delete

CRUD

 
I think the key "ah-ha!" moment is making the connection that `database.ref().on("value", function(snapshot){}` is just an event listener listening for database value changes in whatever "reference" you specify (in the case of `.ref()`, it listens to the entire database)
